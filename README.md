# 30-Day Data Analysis Challenge

## Welcome to My Data Analysis Journey!

Hello there! 👋 This repository documents my intensive 30-day journey to become a proficient data analyst. Whether you're a fellow learner, an experienced data scientist, or just curious about the world of data, I'm excited to share this adventure with you!

## 🎯 Project Goal

The aim of this challenge is to go from basic data handling skills to a solid foundation in data analysis in just 30 days. It's ambitious, it's intense, and it's going to be one heck of a ride!

## 📚 What I'm Learning

Over these 30 days, I'll be diving deep into:

1. Python programming for data analysis
2. Data manipulation with NumPy and Pandas
3. Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
4. SQL for data querying
5. Statistical analysis
6. Introduction to Machine Learning

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository is organized week by week, with each week focusing on different aspects of data analysis:

- [`/Week1`](./Week1): Python Basics and Data Analysis Foundations
- [`/Week2`](./Week2): Advanced Python for Data Analysis and SQL Fundamentals
- `/Week3`: Data Visualization and Statistical Analysis
- `/Week4`: Introduction to Machine Learning and Capstone Project

Within each week's folder, you'll find:
- Daily progress logs
- Code snippets and scripts
- Mini-projects and exercises
- Resources and notes

## 🚀 Follow Along

I'll be updating this repository daily with my progress, code, and insights. Feel free to:

- Watch this repository to get notified of updates
- Check out the code and projects I'm working on
- Leave comments or suggestions (I'm always open to feedback!)
