# Week 1: Python Basics and Data Analysis Foundations

Welcome to the first week of the 30-Day Data Analysis Challenge! This week, we're laying the groundwork for our data analysis journey by focusing on Python basics and introducing fundamental data analysis libraries.

## Goals for the Week

By the end of this week, we aim to:

1. Master Python basics (variables, data types, control structures, functions)
2. Get comfortable with NumPy for numerical computing
3. Begin working with Pandas for data manipulation
4. Understand basic statistical concepts

## Daily Breakdown

### Day 1-2: Python Basics
- Variables and data types
- Control structures (if/else, loops)
- Functions and modules
- Basic file I/O

### Day 3-4: Introduction to NumPy
- NumPy array creation and operations
- Array indexing and slicing
- Basic linear algebra operations

### Day 5-6: Getting Started with Pandas
- Series and DataFrame objects
- Data loading and basic operations
- Data cleaning and preprocessing

### Day 7: Basic Statistics and Review
- Measures of central tendency and dispersion
- Data visualization with Matplotlib
- Review and solidify week's learning

## Projects and Exercises

Throughout the week, we'll be working on several mini-projects:

1. Create a simple calculator program (Day 2)
2. Analyze and manipulate arrays of random numbers (Day 4)
3. Explore and clean a simple dataset (e.g., Titanic dataset from Kaggle) (Day 6)
4. Calculate and visualize basic statistics for our dataset (Day 7)
