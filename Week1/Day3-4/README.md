# Week 1, Day 3-4: My NumPy Adventure

## Learning Goals

By the end of Day 4, I aim to:
1. Create and manipulate NumPy arrays with confidence
2. Perform basic array operations without constantly referring to documentation
3. Use array indexing and slicing effectively in my data analysis tasks
4. Conduct simple linear algebra operations using NumPy

## My Progress

1. [`numpy_basics.py`](./numpy_basics.py): My experiments with NumPy arrays and basic operations
2. [`array_indexing_slicing.py`](./array_indexing_slicing.py): My practice with array indexing and slicing techniques
3. [`linear_algebra_ops.py`](./linear_algebra_ops.py): My exploration of basic linear algebra operations using NumPy
4. [`sales_analysis.py`](./sales_analysis.py): A small project applying NumPy to analyze sales data

## Small Project: Sales Data Analysis

To apply my NumPy skills in a real-world context, I'm creating a small project to analyze sales data for a fictional company. In this project, I'll:

1. Generate sample sales data using NumPy
2. Perform basic statistical analysis on the data
3. Use array operations to calculate monthly and product-wise totals
4. Apply linear algebra concepts to find the best-selling products

This project will help me see how NumPy can be used in a business context for data analysis and decision-making.

## Resources I'm Using

- [NumPy Official Documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)
- [NumPy Quickstart Tutorial](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html)
- [Python Data Science Handbook: NumPy](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/02.00-introduction-to-numpy.html)


## Next Steps

After mastering these NumPy concepts, I'll be ready to dive into Pandas, which I've heard builds on many NumPy ideas to provide powerful data manipulation tools.

Remember, this journey is about my personal growth. It's okay if I don't grasp everything immediately. Progress, not perfection, is the goal!
