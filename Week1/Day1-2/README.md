# Week 1, Day 1-2: My Python Basics Journey

These are my notes and code snippets from the first two days of my data analysis journey, where I'm focusing on Python basics.

## Learning Goals

By the end of Day 2, I aim to be comfortable with:

1. Python syntax and basic data types
2. Variables and operations
3. Control structures (if/else statements, loops)
4. Functions and modules
5. Basic file I/O operations

## My Progress

1. [`python_basics.py`](./python_basics.py): My experiments with variables, data types, and basic operations.
2. [`control_structures.py`](./control_structures.py): My practice with if/else statements and loops.
3. [`functions_and_modules.py`](./functions_and_modules.py): My exploration of function definitions and importing modules.
4. [`file_operations.py`](./file_operations.py): My attempts at reading from and writing to files.
5. [`my_math.py`](./my_math.py): My custom module with basic arithmetic operations.
6. [`calculator.py`](./calculator.py): My implementation of a simple calculator as a Python module.

## Personal Challenges

1. Create a simple calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. Write a program that generates a list of prime numbers up to a limit I specify.
3. Create a function that reads a text file and counts the occurrence of each word, then writes the results to a new file.

## Resources I'm Using

- [Python Official Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
- [W3Schools Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)
- [Real Python - Python Basics](https://realpython.com/python-basics/)

I'm finding that the key to learning programming is practice. I'm not just reading the code â€“ I'm typing it out, experimenting with it, and trying to break it! Understanding how and why things break is helping me learn.

Onward to more Python adventures!
