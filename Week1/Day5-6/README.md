# Week 1, Day 5-6: My Pandas Adventure

## Learning Goals

By the end of Day 6, I aim to:
1. Create and manipulate Pandas Series and DataFrames
2. Load data from various sources into Pandas
3. Perform basic data cleaning and preprocessing
4. Conduct simple data analysis using Pandas

## My Progress

1. [`pandas_basics.py`](./pandas_basics.py): My experiments with Pandas Series and DataFrames
2. [`data_loading.py`](./data_loading.py): My practice with loading data from different sources
3. [`data_cleaning.py`](./data_cleaning.py): My exploration of data cleaning techniques
4. [`data_analysis.py`](./data_analysis.py): A small project applying Pandas for data analysis

## Small Project: Analyzing Movie Ratings

To apply my Pandas skills in a real-world context, I'm creating a small project to analyze movie ratings data. In this project, I'll:

1. Load a dataset of movie ratings
2. Clean and preprocess the data
3. Perform basic statistical analysis
4. Visualize some insights from the data

This project will help me see how Pandas can be used for real data analysis tasks.

## Resources I'm Using

- [Pandas Official Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
- [10 Minutes to Pandas Tutorial](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html)
- [Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney](https://wesmckinney.com/book/)

## Reflections on My Learning

After working through these scripts, I've gained valuable insights into data manipulation and analysis with Pandas:

1. Data cleaning is crucial and often time-consuming, but it's essential for accurate analysis.
2. Pandas provides powerful tools for handling missing data, standardizing values, and correcting data types.
3. The ability to quickly calculate statistics and create visualizations is incredibly useful for understanding datasets.
4. Real-world data often has inconsistencies and requires careful consideration during the cleaning process.
5. Combining and analyzing data from multiple sources (like the movies and ratings datasets) can provide rich insights.

I found the movie ratings analysis particularly interesting, as it showed how we can extract meaningful information from raw data. The visualization of ratings distribution and the trend of ratings over release years were especially insightful.

## Next Steps

After getting comfortable with these Pandas basics, I'm excited to move on with more advanced data manipulation techniques and start combining Pandas with my NumPy knowledge for more complex analysis.

Remember, this journey is about my personal growth. It's okay if I don't grasp everything immediately. Progress, not perfection, is the goal!
