# Week 2, Day 10-11: Advanced Pandas Operations

## Learning Goals

By the end of Day 11, I aim to:
1. Master complex data transformations in Pandas
2. Handle multi-dimensional data effectively
3. Work with time series data
4. Perform advanced grouping and aggregation
5. Merge and join different datasets efficiently

## My Progress

1. [`advanced_transformations.py`](./advanced_transformations.py): Complex data manipulations with gene expression data
2. [`time_series_analysis.py`](./time_series_analysis.py): Working with temporal patient data
3. [`grouping_operations.py`](./grouping_operations.py): Advanced grouping and aggregation techniques
4. [`data_merging.py`](./data_merging.py): Combining multiple biological datasets

## Mini-Project: Gene Expression Analysis

I'm working with a gene expression dataset to practice advanced Pandas operations. This project helps me learn:

1. Data reshaping and pivoting
2. Complex aggregations
3. Time series analysis
4. Data merging and joining
