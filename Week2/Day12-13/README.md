# Week 2, Day 12-13: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

## Learning Goals

By the end of Day 13, I aim to:
1. Master data cleaning techniques
2. Handle missing values effectively
3. Deal with outliers appropriately
4. Perform feature engineering
5. Validate and verify cleaned data

## My Progress

1. [`data_cleaning.py`](./data_cleaning.py): Basic data cleaning operations on clinical data
2. [`outlier_detection.py`](./outlier_detection.py): Methods for identifying and handling outliers
3. [`feature_engineering.py`](./feature_engineering.py): Creating new features from existing data
4. [`data_validation.py`](./data_validation.py): Validating and verifying cleaned data

## Mini-Project: Clinical Trial Data Cleanup

I'm working with a messy clinical trials dataset to practice various cleaning techniques. This project helps me learn:

1. Handling inconsistent data formats
2. Dealing with missing values
3. Identifying and managing outliers
4. Creating meaningful derived features
5. Validating cleaned data
