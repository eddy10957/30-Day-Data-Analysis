# Week 2, Day 14: Integration & End-to-End Pipeline

## Learning Goals

Today I aim to:
1. Combine SQL and Pandas effectively
2. Build a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline
3. Create an end-to-end workflow for clinical data analysis
4. Review and apply all Week 2 concepts

## My Progress

1. [`sql_pandas_integration.py`](./sql_pandas_integration.py): Combining SQL and Pandas operations
2. [`etl_pipeline.py`](./etl_pipeline.py): Building an ETL pipeline for clinical data
3. [`data_pipeline.py`](./data_pipeline.py): Complete end-to-end data analysis pipeline

## Capstone Project: Clinical Data Analysis Pipeline

I'm building an end-to-end pipeline that:
1. Extracts data from multiple sources
2. Cleans and validates the data
3. Performs feature engineering
4. Analyzes the results
5. Generates comprehensive reports

## Resources I'm Using

- [SQLite with Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_sql.html)
- [ETL Best Practices](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_select.html)
- Previous week's scripts and examples

## Notes on Integration

This project brings together all the concepts I've learned this week:
- SQL operations from Days 8-9
- Advanced Pandas from Days 10-11
- Data cleaning and validation from Days 12-13
